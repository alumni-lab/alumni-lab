# Machine Learning
What is it?
- the ability to automatically apply complex mathematical calculations to big data
- born from pattern recognition and the theory that computers can learn without being programmed to perform specific tasks
What is it used for?
- Online recommendation offers such as those from Amazon and Netflix? Machine learning applications for everyday life
- Fraud detection? One of the more obvious, important uses in our world today
- in the health care industry, thanks to the advent of wearable devices and sensors that can use data to assess a patient's health in real time
- Analyzing data to identify patterns and trends is key to the transportation industry, which relies on making routes more efficient and predicting potential problems to increase profitability
What could we build?
- build tests to work out the probability of how long it would take for lighthouse graduates to find work


## The big bit:

Data

- Books!
    - write a book, following patterns
    - Horror script generator
